### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Different Attitudes of Male and Female in Important National Problem in US Presidential Election
+ This project is conducted by Yiwen Fang

+ Project summary: So many investigations have been focused on grand topics categorized by voters' wealth, education, race, Republicans/Democrats. However, what about a small angle, gender, to see special attitudes from male and female towards a particular question, what is the most important national problem. This question reflects their most concerns and affects their choice and decisions on other topics related to the presidential election.

+ Main findings: The investigation focuses on gender differences of attitudes towards the question, what is the most important national problem. The significant patterns of economics, foreign affairs/national defense, and welfare program are explained both in data and politics. These three variables are zoomed in to do a further detailed investigation. Generally speaking, male and female has no much difference for the given variables. However, male cares more about economics while female cares more about welfare.
